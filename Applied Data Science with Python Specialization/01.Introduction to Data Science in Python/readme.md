## About this Course
This course will introduce the learner to the basics of the **python programming environment**, including fundamental python programming techniques such as lambdas, reading and manipulating csv files, and the numpy library. The course will introduce data manipulation and cleaning techniques using the popular python pandas data science library and introduce the abstraction of the Series and DataFrame as the central data structures for data analysis, along with tutorials on how to use functions such as groupby, merge, and pivot tables effectively.

By the end of this course, students will be able to
1. take tabular data
2. clean it manipulate it
3. run basic inferential statistical analyses.

This course should be taken before any of the other Applied Data Science with Python courses: Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python, Applied Machine Learning in Python, Applied Text Mining in Python, Applied Social Network Analysis in Python.

## Week 4

introduced to a variety of statistical techniques such a distributions, sampling and t-tests.

engage in a real-world data cleaning activity and provide evidence for (or against!) a given hypothesis.

This project is suitable for a data science portfolio, and will test your knowledge of cleaning, merging, manipulating, and test for significance in data. The week ends with two discussions of science and the rise of the fourth paradigm -- data driven discovery.
